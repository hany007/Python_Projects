This is a Python Project to create a retrieval based chatbot.
this project is built using deep learning techniques, NLTK, Keras, etc.
The chatbot is trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses.
Using a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then  will give a random response from the list of responses.
